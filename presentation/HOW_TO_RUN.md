# How to Generate the PowerPoint Presentation

To generate the `.pptx` file for the RouteMaster Live presentation, follow these steps:

1.  **Ensure Python is installed**: Open a terminal and run `python --version`.
2.  **Install the required library**:
    Run the following command in your terminal:
    ```bash
    pip install python-pptx
    ```
3.  **Run the generator script**:
    Navigate to this folder and run:
    ```bash
    python generate_ppt.py
    ```
4.  The file `RouteMaster_Live_Presentation.pptx` will be created in this directory.

Alternatively, you can view the content in `RouteMaster_Presentation.md` directly.
